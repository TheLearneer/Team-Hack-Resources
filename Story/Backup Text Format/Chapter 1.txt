their plan to steal something from (starter) and will attack it if (starter) does not give the item to them. (pokemon)
notices (player) and run behind (player). The duo knew that they had to do it the hard way, however Eugene was not willing
to fight. Quinn decided to attack (player) if (player) does not surrender the (starter) to them. (player) refuses to give up
(starter) so both engaged in a battle. Quinn defeats the player with ease. (starter) still refuses to give the item (crystal
shard) so Quinn decided to kill (player and starter) to show Eugene how to be evil. Eugene did not want to witness the death
, so he asked someone[to activate a teleporter], all of a sudden, the duo teleported in front of (player)
eyes. A second afterward, (player and starter) got teleported by accident as well.
